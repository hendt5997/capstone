Paul Stastny (born December 27, 1985) is an American professional ice hockey center, an alternate captain for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL). With the Avalanche having lost top players Joe Sakic and Ryan Smyth to injuries, Ryan Kennedy of The Hockey News pointed to Stastny's inconsistency and wrote it was time for Stastny to step up and be a leader in all aspects. Before moving to Denver in 1995, the Colorado Avalanche were the Quebec Nordiques, the team for which his father played from 1980 to 1990 and had his jersey number retired."
