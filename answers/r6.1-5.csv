Diana has a change of heart and repeals her decree. Perhaps Ivanov's most lasting contribution to the ballet's history was the change of title from Sylvia, ou la nymphe de Diane to simply Sylvia. Aminta and Sylvia come together under the deities' good will. Peasants grieve over Aminta's figure until a cloaked Eros revives the shepherd."

The San Francisco Ballet performed Sylvia from April 21, 2006 through May 7 of that year after successful runs in 2004 and 2005. Compassionate Eros gives Diana a vision. Aminta and Sylvia come together under the deities' good will."
