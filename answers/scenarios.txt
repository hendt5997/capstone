Brief Scenario Descriptions

1. User who did not previously use removable drives or work after
hours begins logging in after hours, using a removable drive, and
uploading data to wikileaks.org. Leaves the organization shortly
thereafter.

2. User begins surfing job websites and soliciting employment from a
competitor. Before leaving the company, they use a thumb drive (at
markedly higher rates than their previous activity) to steal data.

3. System administrator becomes disgruntled. Downloads a keylogger and
uses a thumb drive to transfer it to his supervisor's machine. The
next day, he uses the collected keylogs to log in as his supervisor
and send out an alarming mass email, causing panic in the
organization. He leaves the organization immediately.

4. A user logs into another user's machine and searches for
interesting files, emailing to their home email. This behavior occurs
more and more frequently over a 3 month period.

5. A member of a group decimated by layoffs uploads documents to
Dropbox, planning to use them for personal gain.
